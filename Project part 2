20, 3, 93, 89, 86, 90, Experimental results showed that pulsed flow without flow reversal had no significant effect compared with steady flow, 
21, 4, 83, 80, 76, 85, Further research is recommended to determine the maximum achievable enhancement, 
22, 5, 84, 81, 87, 86, This is likely due to the large disturbances in the hydrodynamic boundary layer when the flow changes direction, 
23, 3, 86, 87, 84, 86, It should be noted that the experimental results do not agree with the theoretical equations, 
24, 4, 98, 96, 96, 97, Both designs incorporate round piers on piled foundations, which are used because the soil conditions are unknown and possibly unstable,
